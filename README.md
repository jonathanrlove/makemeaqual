Generating practice tests using questions from old Stanford math qualifying exams.

Live version available at https://jonathanlove.info/qual/makeit.html

To function properly, all the following files need to be in the same folder:
- index.html
- personalqual.html
- qtags.js
- style.css
- images containing exam problems, labeled [alg / ana] + [year] + [S / F] + [M / A] + [question number]; for example, alg2010FM3.png, alg2012SA5.png, ana2012FA1.png.

This repository contains all of the above except for the image files. Old Stanford qualifying exam problems can be found at this page: https://mathematics.stanford.edu/phd-program/phd-qualifying-exams.
